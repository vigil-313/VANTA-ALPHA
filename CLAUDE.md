# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

V0_VANTA is a new version of the VANTA (Voice-based Ambient Neural Thought Assistant) project, focused on creating a real-time, voice-based AI assistant that behaves like an ambient presence. The original VANTA implementation encountered significant challenges, and this repository represents a redesign effort using the VISTA methodology for improved architecture and implementation.

### Core Components

1. **Voice Pipeline**: Audio input/output processing with continuous listening and voice responses
2. **Memory Engine**: Sophisticated conversation storage with semantic retrieval  
3. **Reasoning Engine**: LLM-based intelligence for contextual understanding and response
4. **Personality System**: Adaptive traits, mood, and behavior
5. **Scheduler**: Goal tracking and time-based actions

## VISTA Protocol

This project follows the VISTA (Versatile Intelligent System for Technical Acceleration) methodology, which requires:

1. **Documentation Hierarchy**: Creating structured documentation for different audiences (Executive, Management, Technical, Development)
2. **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintaining SESSION_STATE.md and KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md across planning sessions
3. **Implementation Planning**: Breaking down development into discrete, manageable tasks
4. **Documentation-Code Synchronization**: Updating documentation to reflect implementation changes

### VISTA Session Protocol

When developing this project:

1. Begin each session with: `# DOCPROTOCOL: Claude will (1)Load system context from SESSION_STATE.md (2)Process new information (3)Update all affected documents (4)Maintain cross-references via unique IDs (5)Version all changes (6)Generate comprehensive session summary (7)Update knowledge graph (8)Prepare handoff state for next session`

2. Use consistent document formatting with unique identifiers (DOC-XX-YY, CON-XX-YY, DEC-XX-YY)

3. Maintain visual progress indicators with emoji status markers (ðŸŸ¢ Complete, ðŸŸ¡ In Progress, ðŸ”´ Not Started, âšª Not Applicable)

4. Keep cross-references updated between documents 

5. Update SESSION_STATE.md and KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md at the end of every session

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Modular Architecture**: Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Use an event bus pattern for loose coupling
- **Async-First**: Design for real-time responsiveness
- **Error Resilience**: Implement proper error handling, especially for audio processing
- **Resource Management**: Monitor and constrain resource usage for stable operation

## Important Notes
- When making commits, please DO NOT include references to Claude, Claude Code, or Anthropic in the commit messages.
- THROUGHOUT ALL STEPS, SESSION_STATE.md AND KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md MUST BE UPDATED USING VISTA PROTOCOL!

## VANTA Code Organization Rule: VISTA Documentation References

  RULE: All code implementations must include references to related VISTA documentation using standardized tags.

  Standard Tag Formats

  1. Task References:
  # TASK-REF: ENV_002 - Docker Environment Setup
  2. Concept References:
  # CONCEPT-REF: CON-VANTA-008 - Docker Environment
  3. Documentation References:
  # DOC-REF: DOC-ARCH-001 - V0 Architecture Overview
  4. Decision References:
  # DECISION-REF: DEC-002-005 - Use Docker for development environment

  Placement Rules

  1. Place tags at the top of files, immediately after any license/copyright notices
  2. For functions, classes, or significant code blocks, place tags immediately above the definition
  3. Group related tags together
  4. Always include at least one task reference for any implementation file

  Example

  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
  """
  VANTA Voice Pipeline Implementation
  """
  # TASK-REF: ENV_002 - Docker Environment Setup
  # CONCEPT-REF: CON-VANTA-008 - Docker Environment
  # DOC-REF: DOC-ARCH-001 - V0 Architecture Overview
  # DECISION-REF: DEC-002-005 - Use Docker for development environment

  import os
  import sys
  import logging

  # More code...

  class AudioProcessor:
      """
      Audio processing component for voice pipeline.
      """
      # TASK-REF: VOICE_001 - Audio Processing Component
      # CONCEPT-REF: CON-VANTA-001 - Voice Pipeline

      def __init__(self):
          # Implementation...

  This rule ensures all code is traceable back to its VISTA documentation, maintains knowledge continuity, and helps future developers understand the context and purpose of each implementation element.
