# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-037
- Previous Session: SES-V0-036
- Timestamp: 2025-05-20T20:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-036, where we successfully implemented the Local Model Optimization (LM_002) task to optimize local model performance across different hardware configurations. 

Following the updated critical path identified in the previous session, this session focused on implementing the Streaming Response Handling (AM_002) task. This task enhances the API Model Client with sophisticated streaming capabilities, including stream control, event handling, and performance monitoring. The streaming implementation is a critical prerequisite for the dual-track processing architecture, allowing both local and API models to work together efficiently in real-time.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Completed the Streaming Response Handling (AM_002) implementation:
   - Created a comprehensive streaming framework with modular components
   - Implemented thread-safe stream state management and control
   - Added real-time token handling with event-based notification
   - Developed performance monitoring and statistics for streaming
   - Implemented stream control (pause, resume, cancel)

2. Designed and implemented key streaming components:
   - `StreamHandler`: Interface for handling streaming events
   - `BufferedStreamHandler`: Collects tokens into a complete response
   - `ConsoleStreamHandler`: Displays tokens on the console in real-time
   - `CallbackStreamHandler`: Executes user-provided callbacks for stream events
   - `StreamManager`: Manages streaming process and state
   - `StreamProcessor`: Processes tokens and dispatches to handlers
   - `StreamConfig`: Configuration for streaming parameters

3. Integrated streaming components with the API Manager:
   - Added `generate_stream_with_handlers` method to APIModelManager
   - Ensured compatibility with both Anthropic and OpenAI providers
   - Created comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Added example code for various streaming scenarios

4. Added new functionality for streaming responses:
   - Stream control for pausing, resuming, and cancelling streams
   - Real-time token aggregation and event handling
   - Performance monitoring with detailed statistics
   - Concurrent streaming from multiple providers

## Critical Path for Implementation (Updated)
The critical path for completing the dual-track architecture is now:

1. Integrate Memory System with LangGraph - Now the top priority
2. Complete prompt templates for Local Models (LM_003)
3. Create integration tests for both models
4. Implement the Processing Router (DP_001)
5. Implement Response Integration (DP_002)
6. Optimize the Dual-Track system (DP_003)

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-037 focused on implementing the Streaming Response Handling (AM_002) component, which was identified as the critical path dependency for the dual-track processing architecture in the previous session.
