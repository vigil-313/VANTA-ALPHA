## Knowledge State
This session focused on evaluating technical frameworks for the V0_VANTA architecture, specifically examining LangGraph and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for their potential in building a robust voice assistant system. We've conducted in-depth analysis of both frameworks and documented how they could be integrated to create a flexible, modular architecture for VANTA.

LangGraph provides powerful orchestration capabilities through its graph-based workflow engine, which aligns well with VANTA's need for stateful processing and conversation management. MCP offers standardized interfaces for accessing diverse data sources and tools, which would enable extensibility and clean separation of concerns in the VANTA architecture.

We've identified a potential hybrid architecture that leverages LangGraph for core workflow orchestration and MCP for standardized access to external capabilities. This approach would allow for modular development and flexible deployment options.

Research findings have been documented in several detailed reports, covering implementation strategies, architectural considerations, and server designs. These documents provide a solid foundation for further exploration before making architectural decisions.

Rather than moving directly to detailed technical architecture and design decisions, we've determined that further exploration, tutorial development, and research is needed. This will include creating more visual documentation, step-by-step guides, and conducting web searches for the latest information and best practices.
