# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-032
- Previous Session: SES-V0-031
- Timestamp: 2025-05-25T10:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-031, where we implemented a working microphone bridge for Docker on macOS. In this session, we focused on realigning with the implementation plan by creating prompts for the Local Model Integration (LM_001, LM_002, LM_003) and API Model Client Integration (AM_001), which were identified as prerequisites for the Memory System integration with LangGraph.

We have created comprehensive task prompts that follow the established structure and VISTA protocol. These prompts provide detailed guidance for implementing the Local Model and API Model components, including requirements, architecture, component design, implementation approaches, and testing requirements.

The Local Model integration will leverage llama.cpp to provide fast, on-device language model capabilities, while the API Model client will provide connectivity to cloud-based models like Claude and GPT-4. These components are critical parts of VANTA's dual-track processing architecture, where the local model handles immediate responses while the API model processes more complex reasoning tasks.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Analyzed the implementation plan and identified that we had skipped the Local Model and API Model tasks before proceeding to Memory System integration with LangGraph.

2. Created comprehensive task prompts for Local Model integration:
   - LM_001_Local_Model_Integration.md: Core integration of llama.cpp
   - LM_002_Local_Model_Optimization.md: Performance optimization for target hardware
   - LM_003_Prompt_Engineering.md: Prompt templates and strategies for local models

3. Created a comprehensive task prompt for API Model integration:
   - AM_001_API_Model_Client.md: Client implementation for Claude and GPT-4

4. Realigned the development process with the original implementation plan sequence.

## Decision Record
- DEC-032-001: Prioritize implementation of Local Model and API Model components before Memory System integration with LangGraph
  - Rationale: Following the original implementation plan sequence ensures proper dependencies are addressed
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: The Memory System is already implemented but its integration with LangGraph should follow Local Model and API Model implementation

- DEC-032-002: Implement both Claude and GPT-4 clients for API Model integration
  - Rationale: Supporting multiple providers offers flexibility and fallback options
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Initial focus will be on Claude, with GPT-4 as a secondary option

- DEC-032-003: Use Metal acceleration for Local Model on macOS
  - Rationale: Metal provides significant performance improvements for neural networks on Apple hardware
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Will require optimization for specific hardware profiles
