# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-039
- Previous Session: SES-V0-038
- Timestamp: 2025-05-21T22:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-038, where we performed a comprehensive audit of the implementation status and identified LangGraph implementation as the critical path for further progress. We discovered that while all core components (Voice Pipeline, Local Model, API Model, and Memory System) have been successfully implemented, the LangGraph integration tasks had not yet been started.

During this session, we created the foundational prompt documents for the LangGraph implementation tasks. These prompts are essential for guiding the implementation of the LangGraph state definition, node functions, and conditional routing that will form the backbone of VANTA's workflow structure.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Created comprehensive LangGraph task prompts for Phase 2 implementation:
   - Created LG_001_LangGraph_State_Definition.md prompt for defining the core state structure
   - Created LG_002_LangGraph_Node_Implementation.md prompt for implementing node functions
   - Created LG_003_Conditional_Routing.md prompt for implementing graph structure and routing

2. Established the implementation structure for the LangGraph integration:
   - Defined the VANTAState TypedDict structure with appropriate annotations
   - Specified the necessary node functions for all VANTA components
   - Designed the conditional routing logic for dynamic workflow decisions
   - Created a comprehensive graph structure for the complete VANTA workflow

3. Ensured alignment with existing VANTA components:
   - Integrated with Voice Pipeline (audio processing, STT, TTS)
   - Integrated with Memory System (context retrieval, conversation storage)
   - Integrated with Local and API Models (dual-track processing)
   - Established interfaces for component communication

4. Prepared for implementation of LangGraph components:
   - Created detailed implementation guidance
   - Provided code examples and patterns
   - Established testing strategies
   - Defined validation criteria

## Decision Record

## Critical Path for Implementation (Updated)
The critical path for completing the dual-track architecture remains:

1. **Implement LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001)** - Prompts created, implementation next
2. **Implement LangGraph Node Functions (TASK-LG-002)** - Follow prompt in implementation
3. **Implement Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003)** - Follow prompt in implementation
4. Only then can we implement:
   - Processing Router (TASK-DP-001)
   - Memory System Integration with LangGraph (TASK-INT-003)

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-039 focused on creating the foundational prompts for LangGraph implementation tasks. We have developed comprehensive implementation guides for the LangGraph state definition, node functions, and conditional routing, which are prerequisites for the Memory System integration with LangGraph and the Dual-Track Processing architecture.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Created LangGraph State Definition Prompt (LG_001)**: Defined the core state structure for VANTA
2. **Created LangGraph Node Implementation Prompt (LG_002)**: Specified node functions for all components
3. **Created Conditional Routing Prompt (LG_003)**: Designed the graph structure and routing logic
4. **Updated Implementation Progress**: Marked tasks as in-progress with appropriate percentages

### Current Status
- **Phase 0 Setup**: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Phase 1 Core Components**: 
  - Voice Pipeline: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - Local Model: Integration and optimization complete, prompt engineering in progress (25%)
  - API Model: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - Memory System: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Phase 2 Workflow Integration**:
  - LangGraph Components: Prompts created, implementation in progress (10-20%)
  - Dual-Track Processing: Not yet started (0% complete)

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001) following the created prompt
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Begin implementation of LangGraph Node Functions (TASK-LG-002)
3. **IMMEDIATE**: Begin implementation of Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003)
4. **IMPORTANT**: Continue developing prompt templates for Local Models (LM_003)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Complete API Model streaming integration tests

The next session should focus on actual implementation of the LangGraph components, starting with the VANTAState definition (TASK-LG-001), which is the critical path dependency for all further LangGraph integration.
