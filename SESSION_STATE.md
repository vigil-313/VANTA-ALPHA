# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-041
- Previous Session: SES-V0-040
- Timestamp: 2025-05-22T09:15:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-040, where we implemented the foundational LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001). Building on that foundation, this session focused on implementing the complete set of LangGraph node functions (TASK-LG-002), which represent the core processing workflow of the VANTA system.

During this session, we implemented nine comprehensive node functions covering voice processing, memory operations, and dual-track model processing. These nodes form the complete processing pipeline that will be orchestrated by the LangGraph workflow, enabling the dual-track architecture that combines local and API models for optimal performance and quality.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Implemented the complete LangGraph Node Functions (TASK-LG-002):
   - Created voice processing nodes: check_activation, process_audio, synthesize_speech
   - Created memory processing nodes: retrieve_context, update_memory, prune_memory
   - Created dual-track processing nodes: router_node, local_model_node, api_model_node, integration_node
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for all node functions
   - Added proper state management and partial state updates

2. Created modular node organization:
   - Organized nodes into logical modules (voice_nodes, memory_nodes, processing_nodes)
   - Implemented proper imports and exports for all node functions
   - Followed VANTA coding conventions with TASK-REF and CONCEPT-REF tags
   - Added comprehensive docstrings for all functions

3. Developed comprehensive unit tests:
   - Created 30+ unit tests covering all node functions
   - Tested normal operation, error handling, and edge cases
   - Added integration tests for complete workflows
   - Implemented proper mocking for external dependencies

4. Established the complete processing workflow:
   - Designed nodes to work together in the dual-track architecture
   - Implemented proper activation flow from listening to speaking
   - Created memory persistence and context retrieval pipeline
   - Built router logic for intelligent processing path selection

## Critical Path for Implementation (Updated)
The critical path for completing the dual-track architecture has progressed with the completion of LG_001:

1. ✅ **Implement LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001)** - Completed
2. **Implement LangGraph Node Functions (TASK-LG-002)** - Next immediate priority
3. **Implement Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003)** - Following LG-002
4. Only then can we implement:
   - Processing Router (TASK-DP-001)
   - Memory System Integration with LangGraph (TASK-INT-003)

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-041 focused on implementing the complete LangGraph Node Functions (TASK-LG-002), building on the state definition from the previous session. We created a comprehensive set of nine node functions covering the entire VANTA processing workflow.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Implemented Complete Node Function Set**: Created 9 node functions covering voice, memory, and dual-track processing
2. **Created Modular Organization**: Organized nodes into voice_nodes, memory_nodes, and processing_nodes modules
3. **Added Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling and graceful degradation in all nodes
4. **Wrote Extensive Unit Tests**: Created 30+ unit tests with integration test workflows
5. **Updated Progress Tracking**: Marked LG_002 as completed (100%)

### Current Status
- **Phase 0 Setup**: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Phase 1 Core Components**: All components implemented except Prompt Engineering (25%)
- **Phase 2 Workflow Integration**:
  - LangGraph State Definition: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - LangGraph Node Functions: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - Conditional Routing: Implementation not yet started (10% including prompt creation)
  - Dual-Track Processing: Not yet started (0% complete)

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Begin implementation of LangGraph Graph Definition and Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003)
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Create graph workflow that orchestrates the implemented nodes
3. **IMPORTANT**: Test complete end-to-end workflow with real components
4. **IMPORTANT**: Begin planning for Dual-Track Processing Router (TASK-DP-001)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Continue developing prompt templates for Local Models (LM_003)

The next session should focus on implementing the LangGraph Graph Definition and Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003) to orchestrate the node functions we just implemented. This will complete the core LangGraph integration and enable the full dual-track processing workflow.
