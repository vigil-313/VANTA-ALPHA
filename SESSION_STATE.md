# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-011
- Previous Session: SES-V0-010
- Timestamp: 2025-05-17T19:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-010, where we completed the Test Framework implementation (ENV_004) task. The Test Framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities for VANTA, including unit, integration, and performance testing, along with specialized utilities for audio and model testing.

The focus of this session is to validate the test environment in the Docker container, ensure all dependencies are properly installed, and prepare for beginning the Voice Pipeline component implementation. The Test Framework implementation completed all the tasks in the Environment Setup sub-phase (ENV_002, ENV_003, ENV_004), allowing us to move forward to core functionality implementation.

Key focus areas for this session include:
1. Ensuring the Docker container has all necessary dependencies for running tests
2. Validating test execution in the containerized environment
3. Updating test-related scripts if needed
4. Documenting the testing workflow in Docker
5. Preparing for Voice Pipeline implementation

This session represents the transition from the foundation setup phase to the actual core component implementation of VANTA.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Updated SESSION_STATE.md to reflect transition to SES-V0-011
2. Enhanced KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md with new testing concepts (CON-TEST-011, CON-TEST-012)
3. Created comprehensive DOCKER_TESTING.md documentation for testing in Docker
4. Implemented a new docker_test.sh script for running tests in Docker containers
5. Updated CONTEXT_FILES.md to reflect the latest implementation progress
6. Installed Docker and resolved Docker container startup issues
7. Modified Docker Compose configuration to work without GPU requirements
8. Fixed Docker test script to properly execute tests in the container
9. Fixed model registry schema and registry files to pass tests
10. Successfully validated all unit, integration, and performance tests in Docker

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Begin Voice Pipeline component implementation
2. Implement audio capture and processing functionality
3. Create the speech-to-text integration
4. Set up the text-to-speech component
5. Continue updating documentation to reflect implementation progress

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-011 has successfully completed the validation of the test environment in Docker, which marks the full completion of all Phase 0 (Setup) tasks. Through this session, we've created comprehensive Docker testing infrastructure that ensures reliable and consistent test execution across different development environments.

### Key Accomplishments
1. Created detailed Docker testing workflow documentation (DOCKER_TESTING.md)
2. Implemented docker_test.sh script for streamlined test execution in Docker containers
3. Added validation capabilities to check Docker environment health
4. Modified Docker Compose configuration to work without GPU requirements
5. Fixed model registry schema and files to pass all tests
6. Successfully ran all unit, integration, and performance tests in Docker environment
7. Added Docker-specific testing concepts to the knowledge graph (CON-TEST-011, CON-TEST-012)
8. Updated project documentation to reflect testing enhancements
9. Added .gitignore file to exclude logs and other generated files from version control

### Test Framework Status
- **Unit Tests**: 6 passing, 3 skipped
- **Integration Tests**: 1 passing
- **Performance Tests**: 1 passing
- **Test Utilities**: Fully operational in Docker environment
- **Mock Objects**: Successfully tested and functional

### Challenges Resolved
1. Resolved Docker installation issues for test environment
2. Fixed Docker Compose configuration to work without GPU acceleration
3. Modified docker_test.sh script to properly execute tests in the container
4. Addressed registry schema and file issues to make tests pass

### Next Steps
With the completion of the environment setup and testing infrastructure (ENV_002, ENV_003, ENV_004, and test validation), we are now ready to move forward to Phase 1 tasks:

1. Create Voice Pipeline implementation prompt (VOICE_001)
2. Begin Voice Pipeline component implementation, starting with audio capture
3. Implement speech-to-text integration with Whisper
4. Create text-to-speech functionality
5. Implement real-time audio processing with appropriate testing

The next session (SES-V0-012) should focus on creating the VOICE_001 prompt and beginning the implementation of the Voice Pipeline component, which is the first core functionality component of the VANTA system.
