## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-045, where we completed the Dual-Track Optimization System implementation (TASK-DP-003). Building on the complete dual-track processing infrastructure with intelligent optimization capabilities, this session focused on implementing the Memory System Integration with LangGraph (TASK-INT-003), which provides seamless integration of the memory system with the LangGraph workflow for intelligent conversation context awareness.

During this session, we implemented comprehensive memory integration that includes enhanced memory nodes for context retrieval and conversation storage, memory-aware dual-track processing, automated conversation summarization, and robust error recovery mechanisms. This completes the core system integration and provides VANTA with intelligent memory-enhanced conversation capabilities while maintaining system resilience and performance.
