## Knowledge State
This session focused on developing a hybrid voice architecture approach for VANTA that combines local and cloud-based language models to create natural, human-like conversational interactions. We've explored how to simulate the dual-process cognitive model of human conversation, including fast/instinctive responses and deeper/more deliberative thinking.

The hybrid voice architecture addresses several critical challenges:
1. Making effective use of the available hardware (MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB RAM)
2. Creating conversational experiences that feel indistinguishable from talking to a human
3. Managing the latency inherent in API-based language models
4. Implementing natural prosody, conversation structure, and social speech elements

We've documented a comprehensive architecture that utilizes local models for immediate responses (backchanneling, simple answers, emotional reactions) while leveraging cloud API models (GPT/Claude) for complex reasoning, synthesis, and "aha moments." This creates a cognitive simulation where responses can transition naturally between quick reactions and thoughtful insights.

Detailed documentation has been created covering:
1. The overall hybrid cognitive model and its theoretical basis
2. Dual processing architecture showing components and their interactions
3. Speech naturalization techniques focusing on prosody, conversation structure, and social elements
4. Implementation considerations for the target hardware environment

The architecture extends our previous work on LangGraph and MCP integration, showing how the dual-processing approach can be implemented using LangGraph's graph-based workflow engine. We've added visual diagrams illustrating the architecture from multiple perspectives, including system components, cognitive model, information flow, hardware resource allocation, and LangGraph implementation.

All documentation follows the VISTA methodology with proper cross-referencing and concept definitions in the Knowledge Graph.
