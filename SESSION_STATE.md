# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-027
- Previous Session: SES-V0-026
- Timestamp: 2025-05-20T18:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-026, where we implemented the file-based TTS bridge for Docker on macOS. In this session, we've focused on completing all platform-related tasks, including native development setup scripts, Linux platform testing tools, performance measurement framework, and comprehensive platform documentation.

We've successfully completed the following components:
1. **Native Development Scripts**: Created setup scripts for macOS and Linux native environments
2. **TTS Bridge Testing**: Implemented test scripts for basic and Docker-based TTS bridge testing
3. **Linux Platform Support**: Created specialized scripts for running and testing on Linux platforms
4. **Performance Measurement**: Developed a comprehensive benchmarking framework for platform implementations
5. **Platform Documentation**: Created detailed documentation of platform capabilities, limitations, and recommendations

These implementations address all our platform-related action items (ACT-024-002, ACT-025-001, ACT-025-002, and ACT-026-001). The solution provides a comprehensive platform abstraction layer that works across multiple environments, with specialized optimizations for each platform and detailed documentation for users.
