## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-042, where we completed the LangGraph Graph Definition and Conditional Routing implementation (TASK-LG-003). Building on that comprehensive workflow orchestration system, this session focused on implementing the Dual-Track Processing Router (TASK-DP-001), which represents the core intelligence for routing queries between local and API models.

During this session, we implemented the complete dual-track processing system with sophisticated query analysis, intelligent routing logic, local and API model controllers, and response integration capabilities. This represents a critical milestone that unlocks the full dual-track processing capabilities and demonstrates the complete VANTA workflow in action.
