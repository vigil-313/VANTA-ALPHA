# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-028
- Previous Session: SES-V0-027
- Timestamp: 2025-05-20T19:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-027, where we implemented platform-related tasks and the file-based TTS bridge for Docker on macOS. In this session, we've focused on implementing a file-based microphone input bridge for Docker containers on macOS and enhanced testing for the TTS bridge in production-like scenarios.

We've successfully completed the following components:
1. **Microphone Input Bridge**: Created a file-based bridge for Docker containers to access the host's microphone
2. **Microphone Client Library**: Developed a Python client for easy integration with container applications
3. **Voice Pipeline Integration**: Implemented a microphone bridge adapter for the Voice Pipeline
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created test scripts for both native and Docker environments
5. **Production TTS Testing**: Implemented production-like testing for the TTS bridge

These implementations address our next steps from the previous session (specifically items 1 and 2). The solution provides a robust approach for Docker containers to access host audio devices on macOS, completing our platform abstraction layer implementation.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Implemented file-based microphone input bridge for Docker on macOS:
   - Created `mic_bridge.sh` for capturing audio from the host microphone
   - Developed `docker_mic_client.py` client library
   - Implemented the `MicBridgeAdapter` class
   - Added bridge adapter for the Voice Pipeline
   - Created comprehensive directory structure for control and audio files

2. Developed test scripts for the microphone bridge:
   - Added `test_mic_bridge.sh` for basic bridge testing
   - Created `test_docker_mic_bridge.sh` for Docker integration testing
   - Implemented `run_voice_demo_with_mic_bridge.sh` launcher script
   - Handled volume mounting and file exchange

3. Enhanced TTS bridge testing:
   - Implemented production-like test scenarios in `test_tts_bridge_production.py`
   - Created test script for comparing native and Docker performance
   - Added performance measurement and error condition testing
   - Implemented concurrent request testing
   - Added comprehensive results logging and analysis

4. Created detailed documentation:
   - Added `MIC_BRIDGE_README.md` with architecture and usage instructions
   - Documented integration with the Voice Pipeline
   - Added troubleshooting information
   - Documented performance considerations and limitations

## Decision Record

- DEC-028-002: Use chunked audio files for real-time processing
  - Rationale: Enables lower latency by processing small chunks of audio
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Balance between latency and file operations overhead

## Open Questions
1. What's the best approach for packaging platform-specific dependencies? (carried over)
2. How to handle continuous integration testing for multi-platform validation? (carried over)
3. What level of AMD hardware acceleration should we implement for the Ryzen AI PC? (carried over)
4. How to optimize memory usage across different platforms with varying resources? (carried over)

6. What would be the most reliable approach for two-way audio communication in Docker? (carried over)
7. How to reduce latency in the file-based bridge approach for real-time applications?
8. Should we explore alternative transport mechanisms (e.g., websockets) for lower latency?

2. **Docker Microphone Client**: Python client library for accessing host microphone
3. **Microphone Bridge Adapter**: Integration with the Voice Pipeline
4. **Test Framework**: Scripts for native and Docker testing
5. **Production Test Utilities**: Comprehensive test scenarios for TTS

### Updated Implementation Plan
- **Production Testing**: Complete in-depth testing of both bridges in real-world scenarios
- **Memory System**: Begin implementation of MEM_001 component
- **Local Model**: Start integration of LM_001 with platform abstraction
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore lower-latency alternatives to file-based bridges
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Add support for AMD Ryzen AI PC

### Next Steps
1. Complete production testing of audio bridges in various scenarios
2. Begin implementing the Memory System component (MEM_001)
3. Start integrating Local Model support (LM_001) with platform abstraction
4. Add AMD hardware acceleration support for Ryzen AI PC targets
5. Explore alternative transport mechanisms for lower latency in bridges

The next session (SES-V0-029) should focus on completing the production testing of the audio bridges, beginning work on the Memory System component, and exploring Local Model integration with the platform abstraction layer.
