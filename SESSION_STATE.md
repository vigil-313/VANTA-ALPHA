# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-006
- Previous Session: SES-V0-005
- Timestamp: 2025-05-18T09:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session focuses on completing the implementation planning process by developing VISTA-compliant task templates and visual implementation diagrams. We're also updating the knowledge graph and session state to ensure continuity between sessions following the VISTA protocol.

The session builds upon the comprehensive implementation plan, roadmap, and technical architecture developed in the previous session. We've enhanced the KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md with additional implementation planning concepts, including:

1. Phased Implementation approach (Foundation through Ambient Presence)
2. Task Structure standards with dependencies and validation criteria
3. Integration patterns for component connections
4. Architecture patterns for system design

We've created visual representations of the implementation planning through mermaid diagrams, providing clear visualization of:
1. Implementation planning framework showing phased approach, task organization, integration patterns, and resource planning
2. Task organization breakdown into functional areas

This session establishes the foundation for moving from planning to implementation by completing key documentation artifacts and ensuring knowledge continuity throughout the development process.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Updated KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md with implementation planning concepts and relationships
2. Added new mermaid diagrams for implementation planning and task organization
3. Updated document relationships in the knowledge graph to reflect new implementation planning documents
4. Enhanced the visual representation of implementation concepts
5. Established timeline for beginning actual implementation

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Complete VISTA implementation task templates
2. Create task template examples for key implementation tasks
3. Begin environment configuration for development setup
4. Prepare for implementation of foundation phase tasks

## Handoff
This concludes session SES-V0-006. The next session (SES-V0-007) will focus on completing the task templates and beginning the actual development environment configuration. We'll then transition from planning to implementation, beginning with the Foundation phase tasks as defined in the implementation plan.
