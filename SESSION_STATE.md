# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-024
- Previous Session: SES-V0-023
- Timestamp: 2025-05-19T23:50:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-023, where we implemented the Platform Abstraction Layer for VANTA. We have successfully refactored the AudioCapture and AudioPlayback classes to use the platform abstraction layer, ensuring cross-platform compatibility while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.

In this session, we've completed the following refactoring tasks:
1. Refactored AudioCapture class to use the platform abstraction layer
2. Refactored AudioPlayback class to use the platform abstraction layer
3. Updated AudioConfig to support platform abstraction configuration
4. Updated Voice Pipeline to work with the refactored audio components
5. Created platform-specific unit tests to validate the refactored components

The implementation provides a robust foundation for running VANTA on both macOS (for development) and Linux (for future deployment on the Ryzen AI PC), directly addressing the Docker audio latency issues by enabling native audio on macOS while maintaining compatibility for future Linux deployment.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Refactored AudioCapture and AudioPlayback classes:
   - Replaced direct PyAudio usage with platform abstraction factory
   - Added platform-specific device selection and configuration
   - Implemented proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. Updated AudioConfig:
   - Added platform-specific configuration sections
   - Created presets for different platforms (native and fallback)
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing configurations
3. Updated Voice Pipeline:
   - Modified initialization to pass platform configuration
   - Ensured proper handling of platform-specific settings
   - Added support for platform presets
4. Created comprehensive unit tests:
   - Implemented tests for refactored audio components
   - Created mocks for platform-specific interfaces
   - Validated functionality in both Docker and native environments

## Decision Record
- DEC-024-001: Prioritize Voice Pipeline demo adaptation for platform abstraction
  - Rationale: The voice demo is a crucial tool for validating the entire pipeline
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Will allow end-to-end testing of the platform abstraction layer

- DEC-024-002: Create native development helper scripts
  - Rationale: Simplify environment setup for native development and testing
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Includes setup scripts for venv creation, dependency installation, and native tests

- DEC-024-003: Implement file-based bridge for Docker audio on macOS
  - Rationale: Addresses the Docker audio latency issues on macOS
  - Status: 🟡 In Progress
  - Notes: File-based approach allows Docker containers to use host audio processing

## Open Questions
1. What's the best approach for packaging platform-specific dependencies?
2. How to handle continuous integration testing for multi-platform validation?
3. What level of AMD hardware acceleration should we implement for the Ryzen AI PC?
4. How to optimize memory usage across different platforms with varying resources?
5. What metrics should we establish for cross-platform performance comparison?
