# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-020
- Previous Session: SES-V0-019
- Timestamp: 2025-05-18T16:45:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-019, where we successfully implemented the complete Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality (VOICE_004) for the VANTA Voice Pipeline. In that session, we created TTS adapters, prosody formatting, and speech synthesis with caching capabilities.

The primary focus of this session is:
1. Updating the Voice Pipeline demo to showcase and verify the TTS functionality
2. Testing our current implementation to ensure all components are working correctly
3. Planning for the next phase of development after validation

This approach will allow us to verify our implementation so far before proceeding with new components like Local Model Integration (LM_001), ensuring a solid foundation for future development.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Updated the Voice Pipeline demo to showcase TTS functionality:
   - Enhanced demo scripts to utilize the newly implemented TTS components
   - Added configuration options for selecting different TTS engines
   - Created example voice outputs to demonstrate the system's capabilities
2. Verified the correct implementation of all voice components:
   - Tested end-to-end audio capture, processing, and playback
   - Validated the integration of STT and TTS components
   - Ensured the system handles edge cases and errors gracefully
3. Created comprehensive documentation for user testing:
   - Added setup instructions for different TTS engines
   - Created a guide for testing voice interaction capabilities
   - Documented configuration options and their effects
4. Prepared for next phase of development:
   - Documented lessons learned and areas for improvement
   - Identified potential challenges for Local Model Integration
   - Created roadmap for upcoming tasks

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-020 has adjusted our immediate priorities to focus on validating our current implementation before proceeding with new components. We've decided to concentrate on enhancing the Voice Pipeline demo with TTS functionality and conducting comprehensive testing to ensure all components work correctly together.

### Key Decisions
1. Postponed work on Local Model Integration (LM_001) until current implementation is validated
2. Prioritized updating demo scripts to showcase and verify TTS functionality
3. Committed to creating comprehensive documentation for user testing
4. Established new action items for demo enhancement and validation

### Updated Plan
- **Demo Enhancement**: Update Voice Pipeline demo to utilize all implemented components
- **Documentation**: Create user testing guide with clear setup instructions and test scenarios
- **Validation**: Conduct comprehensive testing in both Docker and native environments 
- **Planning**: Prepare for Local Model Integration by researching and documenting requirements

### Next Steps
1. Complete the Voice Pipeline demo update with TTS integration
2. Finalize user testing guide with step-by-step instructions
3. Verify all components work correctly in integrated environments
4. Document any issues discovered during testing for future improvements

The next session (SES-V0-021) should focus on finalizing the Voice Pipeline demo and conducting comprehensive testing. After successful validation, we can proceed with planning for Local Model Integration (LM_001) to enable the reasoning capabilities of the VANTA system.
