## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-043, where we completed the Dual-Track Processing Router implementation (TASK-DP-001). Building on that sophisticated routing and processing infrastructure, this session focused on implementing the Dual-Track Response Integration System (TASK-DP-002), which provides seamless coordination between the dual-track processing components and the LangGraph workflow system.

During this session, we implemented enhanced LangGraph integration nodes that utilize the sophisticated ResponseIntegrator class, created comprehensive error handling and timeout management, and developed extensive testing for the complete dual-track workflow. This completes the core dual-track processing capabilities and enables full end-to-end voice assistant functionality with intelligent model coordination.
