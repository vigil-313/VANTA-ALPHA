## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-017, where we implemented the Speech-to-Text (STT) integration (VOICE_003) for the VANTA Voice Pipeline. In this session, we focused on completing the unit tests for the STT components, integrating them fully into the voice pipeline demo, and preparing the implementation prompt for Text-to-Speech (TTS) integration (VOICE_004).

The primary focus has been on:
1. Creating and fixing unit tests for the STT components (WhisperAdapter, Transcriber, TranscriptionProcessor)
2. Updating the voice pipeline demo to incorporate real-time transcription capabilities
3. Creating comprehensive implementation guidance for the upcoming TTS integration
4. Ensuring all tests pass in the Docker testing environment

These developments have completed the STT integration work and laid the groundwork for the next phase of development, which will focus on TTS integration to complete the voice I/O functionality of the VANTA system.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for the STT components:
   - `test_whisper_adapter.py` - Tests for the WhisperAdapter class
   - `test_transcriber.py` - Tests for the Transcriber and TranscriptionQuality
   - `test_transcription_processor.py` - Tests for the TranscriptionProcessor class
2. Updated the Voice Pipeline demo to include STT functionality:
   - Added transcription callback in the voice pipeline demo
   - Updated the demo UI to display transcription results
   - Enhanced demos to show both interim and final transcriptions
3. Created a comprehensive implementation prompt for Text-to-Speech integration (VOICE_004):
   - Defined multiple TTS engines (API-based, local, system)
   - Specified speech synthesis and prosody formatting components
   - Provided detailed implementation examples for all TTS components
4. Ensured all tests pass successfully in the Docker testing environment:
   - Fixed test issues that were preventing successful execution
   - Verified integration of STT components with existing pipeline
5. Created new concepts in KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md related to TTS and prosody control

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Implement unit tests for STT components
2. Integrate STT functionality into demo tools
3. Begin work on Text-to-Speech Integration (VOICE_004)
4. Update documentation to reflect STT implementation

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-017 has successfully implemented the Speech-to-Text Integration (VOICE_003) for the Voice Pipeline. We've created a comprehensive STT system with Whisper model integration, streaming transcription capabilities, and text normalization. The implementation is designed to work efficiently on the target hardware and integrates seamlessly with the existing Voice Pipeline components.

### Key Accomplishments
1. Implemented WhisperAdapter with support for both whisper.cpp and Python implementations
2. Created Transcriber class with streaming transcription support and result caching
3. Implemented TranscriptionProcessor for text normalization and filtering
4. Extended AudioConfig with STT-specific settings and validation
5. Integrated all STT components into the VoicePipeline
6. Added callbacks and event handling for transcription results

### Implementation Details
- **WhisperAdapter**: Provides an interface to Whisper ASR model with efficient resource management, Metal acceleration on Apple Silicon, and flexible configuration options
- **Transcriber**: Offers high-level transcription capabilities with streaming support, confidence filtering, and result caching for better performance
- **TranscriptionProcessor**: Handles text normalization, capitalization, hesitation removal, and confidence-based filtering
- **VoicePipeline Integration**: Speech buffer management, streaming transcription, and callback system for transcription events

### Next Steps
1. Implement unit tests for WhisperAdapter, Transcriber, and TranscriptionProcessor
2. Update demo tools to showcase real-time transcription capabilities
3. Begin implementing VOICE_004 (Text-to-Speech Integration)
4. Consider performance optimizations for STT components

The next session (SES-V0-018) should focus on testing the STT components and potentially starting the Text-to-Speech integration to complete the voice I/O functionality of the Voice Pipeline.
