# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-034
- Previous Session: SES-V0-033
- Timestamp: 2025-05-27T14:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-033, where we implemented the Local Model Integration (LM_001) component for VANTA's dual-track processing architecture. In this session, we focused on implementing the API Model Client (AM_001) component, which is the second critical part of the dual-track architecture, responsible for connecting to cloud-based language models like Claude and GPT-4.

We have implemented a comprehensive API Model Client system with a modular architecture featuring a central manager, provider-specific adapters, and extensive utilities for request formatting, response parsing, and error handling. The implementation supports both Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT models, with a consistent interface that abstracts away provider-specific details while maintaining the flexibility to utilize unique features of each provider.

This implementation completes the second part of VANTA's dual-track processing architecture, enabling integration with powerful cloud-based language models while providing a foundation for the response integration component that will combine outputs from both local and API models.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Implemented the core API Model Client (AM_001) component:
   - Created the APIModelInterface defining the base interface for API model operations
   - Implemented AnthropicClient for integration with Claude models
   - Implemented OpenAIClient for integration with GPT models
   - Developed APIModelManager for model selection and configuration

2. Implemented supporting utilities:
   - Secure credential management for API keys
   - Request formatting for different providers
   - Response parsing and normalization
   - Token counting specific to API models
   - Robust error handling with retry strategies

3. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for the APIModelManager
   - Unit tests for the AnthropicClient and OpenAIClient
   - Integration tests with mock API responses
   - Tests for credential management and error handling

4. Added proper error handling and security features:
   - Comprehensive exception hierarchy
   - Secure credential storage
   - Retry strategies with exponential backoff
   - Content filtering detection

## Decision Record
- DEC-034-001: Use a provider-based design for API model integration
  - Rationale: Provides flexibility for supporting different API providers with a consistent interface
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: The design allows easy addition of new providers beyond Anthropic and OpenAI

- DEC-034-002: Implement environment-variable-based credential management
  - Rationale: Secure storage of API keys without hardcoding in source code
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Supports both environment variables and secure credential storage with proper permissions

- DEC-034-003: Create unified response formatting
  - Rationale: Different API providers return responses in different formats, need standardization
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Response parsing normalizes outputs from different providers for consistent handling

- DEC-034-004: Implement mock clients for testing
  - Rationale: Allows testing without actual API calls or keys
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Mock implementations closely mirror real API behavior for reliable testing

4. **Error Handling**: Developed a comprehensive exception hierarchy with retry strategies
5. **Test Suite**: Created comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Current Status
- **Local Model Integration**: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **API Model Client**: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Local Model Optimization**: Some optimization features implemented as part of LM_001 (10% progress)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Basic templates implemented as part of LM_001 (25% progress) 
- **Memory System**: Fully implemented, LangGraph integration can now begin
- **Dual-Track Integration**: Not yet started, but both component parts are now complete

### Technical Details
The API Model Client implementation includes:
1. **Provider Management**: A flexible system for managing different API providers
2. **Client Adapters**: Specific adapters for Anthropic Claude and OpenAI GPT
3. **Request Formatting**: Provider-specific request formatting for optimal results
4. **Response Parsing**: Unified response parsing to normalize different provider outputs
5. **Security**: Secure credential management with proper permissions
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with retry strategies

### Next Steps
1. Implement Dual-Track Response Integration to combine local and API model outputs
2. Enhance the Local Model with optimization features (LM_002)
3. Begin Memory System integration with LangGraph
4. Add API usage tracking and cost monitoring
