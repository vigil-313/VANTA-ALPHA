# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-009
- Previous Session: SES-V0-008
- Timestamp: 2025-05-20T14:00:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues the active implementation phase of the VANTA system, focusing on the Model Preparation (ENV_003) task from Phase 0 (Setup). The Model Preparation system is a critical component that manages the download, configuration, and validation of machine learning models used throughout the VANTA system, including speech recognition (Whisper), local language models (LLMs), embedding models, and text-to-speech (TTS) models.

The session builds upon the Docker environment implementation completed in SES-V0-008, using the containerized development environment as the foundation for model management. The Model Preparation system implements the specifications from the ENV_003_Model_Preparation.md prompt developed in SES-V0-007.

Key focus areas for this session include:
1. Creating a structured model directory with registry system
2. Implementing scripts for downloading and setting up different model types
3. Developing a comprehensive model management tool
4. Automating model verification and testing
5. Creating detailed documentation for the model preparation process

This session represents the continued progress in the foundation phase of VANTA development, addressing the critical need for consistent model management across development environments.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Implemented the Model Preparation system based on ENV_003 prompt, including:
   - Created structured model directory with separate subdirectories for different model types
   - Set up model registry system with JSON schema for tracking model metadata
   - Implemented scripts for each model type (Whisper, LLM, Embedding, TTS)
   - Developed a comprehensive model management tool with listing, verification, and testing capabilities
   - Created master setup and testing scripts for automation
   - Added detailed documentation in MODEL_PREPARATION.md
2. Added VISTA documentation reference tags to all implementation files
3. Updated implementation README.md with model preparation information
4. Updated SESSION_STATE.md to reflect progress and next steps
5. Created action items for implementing the Testing Framework

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Implement Testing Framework using ENV_004 prompt
2. Validate model preparation implementation with tests
3. Begin Voice Pipeline component implementation
4. Update documentation to reflect progress
5. Iterate based on implementation feedback

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-009 has completed the implementation of the Model Preparation system for VANTA development. We have created a comprehensive model management system with registry, setup scripts, and management tools, establishing a solid foundation for working with the various machine learning models required by VANTA components.

All implementation files are in the Development/Implementation directory with appropriate VISTA documentation reference tags, and detailed documentation is provided in MODEL_PREPARATION.md.

The next steps are:
1. Implement the Testing Framework (ENV_004) in session SES-V0-010
2. Validate the Model Preparation system through testing
3. Begin implementing core VANTA components, starting with the Voice Pipeline

With the completion of both the Docker environment and Model Preparation systems, we are now ready to move forward with the core functionality implementation of VANTA.
