# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-010
- Previous Session: SES-V0-009
- Timestamp: 2025-05-17T19:00:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues the active implementation phase of the VANTA system, focusing on the Test Framework (ENV_004) task from Phase 0 (Setup). The Test Framework is a critical component that enables comprehensive testing of the VANTA system, including unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing capabilities.

The session builds upon the Model Preparation system implemented in SES-V0-009, using the models directory and registry for validation tests. The Test Framework implements the specifications from the ENV_004_Test_Framework_Setup.md prompt developed in SES-V0-007.

Key focus areas for this session include:
1. Creating a structured test directory with various test types
2. Implementing test utilities and mock objects for testing
3. Setting up test fixtures and configuration
4. Creating example tests for different test types
5. Adding model-specific validation tests
6. Setting up CI integration

This session represents the continued progress in the foundation phase of VANTA development, completing the third and final task in the Environment Setup sub-phase.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Implemented the Test Framework based on ENV_004 prompt, including:
   - Created structured test directory with separate subdirectories for different test types
   - Implemented test utilities for general testing, audio testing, and model testing
   - Created mock objects for audio capture, TTS, and language models
   - Set up test fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Added example tests for unit, integration, and performance testing
   - Created model validation tests for the Model Preparation system

2. Added VISTA documentation reference tags to all implementation files
3. Updated TEST_STRATEGY.md with comprehensive testing approach
4. Created detailed TEST_FRAMEWORK.md documentation
5. Created test execution script for convenience
6. Updated SESSION_STATE.md to reflect progress and next steps

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Validate test environment in Docker container
2. Ensure dependency installation and proper test execution
3. Begin Voice Pipeline component implementation
4. Update documentation to reflect progress
5. Iterate based on implementation feedback

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-010 has completed the implementation of the Test Framework for VANTA development. We have created a comprehensive test system with unit, integration, and performance testing capabilities, along with specialized utilities for audio and model testing. This completes all the planned environment setup tasks (ENV_002, ENV_003, and ENV_004).

All implementation files are in the Development/Implementation/tests directory with appropriate VISTA documentation reference tags, and detailed documentation is provided in TEST_FRAMEWORK.md and tests/README.md.

The next steps are:
1. Validate the test environment in the Docker container in session SES-V0-011
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed and tests run correctly
3. Begin implementing core VANTA components, starting with the Voice Pipeline

With the completion of the environment setup tasks, we are now ready to move forward with the implementation of core VANTA functionality.
