The primary focus of this session is:
1. Completing the Voice Pipeline demo enhancements with TTS functionality
2. Finalizing the user testing guide for the Voice Pipeline demo
3. Verifying all components work correctly in an integrated environment
4. Preparing for the next phase of development (Local Model Integration)

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Conduct user testing with the enhanced Voice Pipeline demo
2. Begin implementation planning for Local Model Integration (LM_001)
3. Research API Model Integration (AM_001) requirements
4. Develop integration patterns for connecting Voice Pipeline with LLM components

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-021 has successfully completed the Voice Pipeline demo enhancements and user testing documentation. We've now validated all Voice Pipeline components and prepared the groundwork for the next phase of development focused on integrating Local Models.

### Key Decisions
1. Successfully completed TTS demo functionality and user testing guide
2. Created specialized testing tools for Voice Pipeline validation
3. Added comprehensive performance benchmarking capabilities
4. Established new action items for user testing and Local Model Integration

### Updated Plan
- **User Testing**: Conduct testing with the enhanced demo to gather feedback
- **LM Integration**: Begin implementing Local Model Integration (LM_001)
- **API Integration**: Research and plan API Model Integration (AM_001)
- **Memory System**: Begin research on Memory System implementation (MEM_001)

### Next Steps
1. Gather user feedback on Voice Pipeline demo and TTS functionality
2. Implement Local Model Integration (LM_001) with small-footprint LLMs
3. Create integration layer between Voice Pipeline and LLM components
4. Design state management for context persistence across components

The next session (SES-V0-022) should focus on implementing Local Model Integration (LM_001) now that we have a fully functional and validated Voice Pipeline. With the voice I/O components complete, we can begin building the reasoning capabilities that will give VANTA its intelligence.
