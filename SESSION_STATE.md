# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-038
- Previous Session: SES-V0-037
- Timestamp: 2025-05-21T20:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session follows SES-V0-037, where we successfully implemented the Streaming Response Handling (AM_002) task to enhance the API Model Client with sophisticated streaming capabilities.

During this session, we performed a thorough review of the implementation status to align the SESSION_STATE.md with the actual code implementation and the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md. We discovered that while all core components (Voice Pipeline, Local Model, API Model, and Memory System) have been successfully implemented, the LangGraph integration tasks have not yet been started. This is a critical dependency before we can proceed with Memory System integration with LangGraph.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:

1. Performed a comprehensive audit of code implementation vs. implementation plan:
   - Confirmed completion of all Phase 0 (Setup) tasks
   - Confirmed completion of most Phase 1 (Core Components) tasks
   - Identified that Phase 2 (Workflow Integration) tasks haven't been started

2. Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with accurate status information:
   - Updated statuses of all completed tasks
   - Corrected the status of in-progress tasks (LM_003)
   - Identified LangGraph implementation as the current critical path

3. Revised SESSION_STATE.md (this document) to align with project reality:
   - Corrected the critical path and next steps
   - Ensured alignment with the implementation plan
   - Clearly identified the correct sequence of tasks

4. Created plan for the next session:
   - Identified LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001) as the next priority
   - Prepared to create LangGraph task prompts in the next session

## Decision Record
- DEC-038-001: Prioritize LangGraph implementation before Memory-LangGraph integration 
  - Rationale: Cannot integrate Memory with LangGraph without first implementing LangGraph state and nodes
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: This corrects the previous misalignment between SESSION_STATE.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

- DEC-038-002: Create dedicated LangGraph task prompts in Phase2_Workflow directory
  - Rationale: Need proper documentation and requirements for LangGraph implementation tasks
  - Status: 🟢 Approved
  - Notes: Will be the first priority in the next session

## Critical Path for Implementation (Updated)
The critical path for completing the dual-track architecture is now:

1. **Implement LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001)** - Now the top priority
2. Implement LangGraph Node Implementation (TASK-LG-002)
3. Implement Conditional Routing (TASK-LG-003)
4. Only then can we implement:
   - Processing Router (TASK-DP-001)
   - Memory System Integration with LangGraph (TASK-INT-003)

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-038 focused on realigning our implementation plan with the actual state of the code. We discovered that while all Phase 1 Core Components have been successfully implemented, we have not yet started the Phase 2 LangGraph implementation tasks, which are prerequisites for the Memory System integration with LangGraph.

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Performed Implementation Audit**: Thoroughly reviewed the implementation status of all tasks
2. **Updated Implementation Plan**: Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with accurate status information
3. **Corrected Critical Path**: Identified LangGraph implementation as the current critical path
4. **Clarified Next Steps**: Created clear action items for the next session

### Current Status
- **Phase 0 Setup**: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Phase 1 Core Components**: 
  - Voice Pipeline: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - Local Model: Integration and optimization complete, prompt engineering in progress (25%)
  - API Model: Fully implemented (100% complete)
  - Memory System: Fully implemented (100% complete)
- **Phase 2 Workflow Integration**:
  - LangGraph Components: Not yet started (0% complete)
  - Dual-Track Processing: Not yet started (0% complete)

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Create LangGraph task prompts for Phase 2 implementation (TASK-LG-001, TASK-LG-002, TASK-LG-003)
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001)
3. **IMPORTANT**: Continue developing prompt templates for Local Models (LM_003)
4. **IMPORTANT**: Complete API Model streaming integration tests
5. **IMPORTANT**: Create integration tests for Local Model

The next session should focus on creating the LangGraph task prompts and beginning the implementation of the LangGraph State Definition (TASK-LG-001), which is the critical path dependency for all further LangGraph integration.
