# Current Session State

## Session Information
- Session ID: SES-V0-012
- Previous Session: SES-V0-011
- Timestamp: 2025-05-18T10:30:00Z
- Template Version: v1.0.0

## Knowledge State
This session continues from SES-V0-011, where we completed the validation of the test environment in Docker, marking the full completion of all Phase 0 (Setup) tasks. With the Docker environment, model preparation system, and testing framework fully implemented and validated, we are now ready to begin Phase 1 (Core Components) implementation.

The focus of this session is to create the implementation prompts for the Voice Pipeline component, which is the first core functionality component in the VANTA system. The Voice Pipeline is responsible for audio input/output processing, speech recognition, and speech synthesis, forming the interface between the user and the core processing system.

Key focus areas for this session include:
1. Creating implementation prompts for the Voice Pipeline components
2. Defining the implementation approach for audio processing infrastructure
3. Specifying the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) implementation
4. Detailing the Speech-to-Text (STT) integration with Whisper
5. Preparing for actual Voice Pipeline implementation in the next session

This session represents the beginning of core functionality implementation for VANTA, moving from the foundation setup to building the voice interaction capabilities.

## Session Outcomes
During this session, we have:
1. Updated SESSION_STATE.md to reflect transition to SES-V0-012
2. Created a directory structure for Voice Pipeline implementation prompts
3. Developed VOICE_001_Audio_Processing_Infrastructure.md implementation prompt
4. Developed VOICE_002_Voice_Activity_Detection.md implementation prompt
5. Developed VOICE_003_Speech_to_Text_Integration.md implementation prompt
6. Defined detailed directory structure for Voice Pipeline implementation 
7. Specified interfaces for all core Voice Pipeline components
8. Outlined implementation approach for audio capture and playback
9. Specified Voice Activity Detection with multiple activation modes
10. Detailed Speech-to-Text integration using Whisper model

## Next Session Focus Areas
1. Implement Audio Processing Infrastructure (VOICE_001)
2. Create audio capture and playback components
3. Implement audio preprocessing functionality
4. Begin Voice Activity Detection implementation (VOICE_002)
5. Set up basic Speech-to-Text integration (VOICE_003)

## Handoff
Session SES-V0-012 has successfully created the implementation prompts for the Voice Pipeline component, which is the first core functionality component of the VANTA system. These prompts provide a comprehensive guide for implementing the audio processing infrastructure, voice activity detection, and speech-to-text integration.

### Key Accomplishments
1. Created VOICE_001_Audio_Processing_Infrastructure.md implementation prompt with detailed requirements for audio capture, preprocessing, and playback
2. Created VOICE_002_Voice_Activity_Detection.md implementation prompt with specifications for speech detection and system activation
3. Created VOICE_003_Speech_to_Text_Integration.md implementation prompt with details for Whisper model integration
4. Defined a clear directory structure for the Voice Pipeline implementation
5. Specified interfaces for all major Voice Pipeline components
6. Outlined integration patterns with the LangGraph workflow
7. Provided detailed technical considerations for performance, error handling, and resource management
8. Included comprehensive testing requirements and validation criteria

### Implementation Prompts Summary
- **VOICE_001**: Covers audio capture from microphone, audio preprocessing (normalization, noise reduction), and audio playback, with a focus on real-time processing and resource efficiency
- **VOICE_002**: Specifies Voice Activity Detection using ML models, wake word recognition ("Hey Vanta"), and activation state management with different modes
- **VOICE_003**: Details Speech-to-Text integration using Whisper models (both C++ and Python implementations), transcription processing, and streaming transcription capabilities

### Component Structure
The implementation will follow this structure:
```
/Development/Implementation/src/voice/
├── audio/         # Audio capture, preprocessing, playback
├── vad/           # Voice activity detection, wake word
├── stt/           # Speech-to-text with Whisper
├── tts/           # Text-to-speech (future)
└── pipeline.py    # Main coordination
```

### Next Steps
With the completion of the Voice Pipeline implementation prompts, we are now ready to begin the actual implementation of the Voice Pipeline components:

1. Implement the Audio Processing Infrastructure (VOICE_001) with audio capture, preprocessing, and playback
2. Begin Voice Activity Detection (VOICE_002) implementation with basic speech detection
3. Start integrating Whisper for Speech-to-Text (VOICE_003)
4. Create unit tests for each component
5. Integrate components into a cohesive pipeline

The next session (SES-V0-013) should focus on implementing the audio processing infrastructure based on the VOICE_001 prompt, which forms the foundation for all other Voice Pipeline components.
