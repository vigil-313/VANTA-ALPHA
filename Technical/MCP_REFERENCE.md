# Model Context Protocol Reference
Document ID: [DOC-TECH-MCP-1]

## Overview
This document provides a reference summary of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its potential relevance to the V0_VANTA project.

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. It standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Core MCP Architecture
MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

- **MCP Hosts [CON-TECH-002]**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients [CON-TECH-003]**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers [CON-TECH-004]**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through MCP
- **Resources**: Data and content exposed by servers to LLMs
- **Tools**: Actions LLMs can perform through servers
- **Prompts**: Reusable templates for LLM interactions

## Key Capabilities of MCP

1. **Resources**: Expose data and content from servers to LLMs
   - File systems, databases, knowledge bases, etc.
   
2. **Tools**: Enable LLMs to perform actions through servers
   - Execute commands, access APIs, modify data, etc.
   
3. **Prompts**: Create reusable prompt templates and workflows
   - Define consistent interaction patterns for specific tasks
   
4. **Sampling**: Allow servers to request completions from LLMs
   - Enable servers to use LLM capabilities directly
   
5. **Transports**: Communication mechanisms between clients and servers
   - WebSockets, HTTP, etc.

## Potential Relevance to VANTA

The Model Context Protocol could potentially be integrated with VANTA in several ways:

1. **Data Access**: VANTA could use MCP to access various data sources (calendar, files, knowledge bases) through standardized interfaces

2. **Tool Integration**: MCP could provide a consistent way for VANTA to interact with external tools and services

3. **Context Management**: MCP's resource and prompt capabilities could enhance VANTA's context building for more relevant responses

4. **LLM Flexibility**: Using MCP could make it easier to switch between different LLM providers

5. **Extensibility**: The modular nature of MCP servers would allow VANTA to be extended with new capabilities over time

## Considerations for Integration

1. **Voice Integration**: MCP currently doesn't have specific features for voice interfaces, so additional components would be needed

2. **Real-time Performance**: Need to evaluate if MCP's architecture can meet VANTA's real-time requirements

3. **Ambient Presence**: Consider how MCP's request-response pattern would work in an ambient, always-listening context

4. **Custom Servers**: We might need to develop custom MCP servers for voice processing, memory management, etc.

## Documentation References

Comprehensive MCP documentation is available in the indexed directory:

- Knowledge Graph: See [CON-TECH-001] through [CON-TECH-004] in KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md

## Conclusion

MCP provides a standardized approach for LLM integration with data sources and tools that could potentially benefit the VANTA architecture. Further research and specific use case analysis should be conducted to determine the appropriate integration strategy.
