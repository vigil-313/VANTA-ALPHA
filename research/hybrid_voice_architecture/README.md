# Hybrid Voice Architecture Research [DOC-RESEARCH-HVA-1]

## Overview

This research explores a hybrid cognitive architecture for VANTA's voice interaction system that combines local and cloud-based language models to create natural, human-like conversational interactions. The architecture simulates the dual-process cognitive model of human conversation, including fast/instinctive responses and deeper/more deliberative thinking.

## Key Concepts

- **[CON-HVA-001]**: Dual-track Processing - Using local models for immediate responses while cloud APIs handle complex reasoning
- **[CON-HVA-002]**: Cognitive Simulation - Replicating human thought patterns including epiphanic moments and natural speech cadence
- **[CON-HVA-003]**: Hardware Optimization - Making efficient use of available computing resources (M4 MacBook Pro)
- **[CON-HVA-004]**: Latency Management - Creating the perception of real-time conversation despite processing delays
- **[CON-HVA-005]**: Prosody Control - Implementing natural pauses, emphasis, and rhythm in speech output

## Directory Structure

- `/design`: Comprehensive documentation on architecture components and design philosophy
- `/diagrams`: Visual representations of the architecture using Mermaid diagrams
- `/implementation_notes`: Technical specifications and implementation guidance

## Research Goals

1. Design a voice interaction system that feels indistinguishable from human conversation
2. Create a practical implementation that performs well on consumer hardware
3. Document the architecture in sufficient detail for implementation
4. Establish evaluation criteria for measuring conversational naturalness

## Research Status

This research is ongoing, with current focus on:
- ðŸŸ¡ Hybrid processing approach using both local and cloud models
- ðŸŸ¡ Natural speech patterns including backchanneling and prosody
- ðŸ”´ Memory systems that mimic human recall patterns
- ðŸ”´ Social intelligence features for contextually appropriate responses
