# Example Voice Pipeline Task - STT Integration

## Task Identification
- **Task ID**: TSK-V0-001
- **Component**: Voice Pipeline
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Related Concepts**: [CON-VANTA-001, CON-VANTA-005, CON-HVA-017]

## Task Description
Implement the Speech-to-Text (STT) component of the Voice Pipeline using Whisper model, providing an interface for converting audio input into text for further processing by the dual-track processing system.

### Objective
Create a modular, high-performance STT component that efficiently converts audio to text with configurable quality settings.

### Success Criteria
The system can convert spoken audio to text with >90% accuracy in quiet environments and >75% accuracy in noisy environments, with processing latency under 1.5 seconds for 5-second audio segments.

## Implementation Context
The STT component is a core part of the Voice Pipeline, which is responsible for capturing audio input and converting it to text for processing by the LLM systems. This component must be designed for both performance and quality, with configuration options to balance between these factors based on the system's operational context.

### Task Dependencies
- **TSK-V0-000**: Set up basic project structure and environment
- **TSK-V0-002**: Implement audio capture system (can be worked on in parallel)

### Architectural Context
The STT component is part of the Voice Pipeline in the hybrid architecture. It receives audio input from the audio capture system and outputs text to the dual-track processing component. It must integrate with the LangGraph state management system to maintain conversation context.

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement Whisper model integration with configurable model size (tiny, base, small, medium)
2. Support real-time audio processing with streaming capabilities
3. Provide confidence scores for transcription results
4. Implement language detection or make language configurable
5. Handle background noise and multiple speakers
6. Provide mechanism for hardware acceleration when available

## Implementation Details

### Interfaces
```python
class SpeechToTextComponent:
    def __init__(self, config: STTConfig):
        """Initialize the STT component with configuration."""
        pass
        
    def process_audio(self, audio_data: numpy.ndarray, sample_rate: int) -> STTResult:
        """
        Process audio data and return transcription result.
        
        Args:
            audio_data: The audio data as a numpy array
            sample_rate: The sample rate of the audio data
            
        Returns:
            STTResult containing transcript, confidence, and metadata
        """
        pass
        
    def process_stream(self, audio_stream: AudioStream) -> Generator[STTResult, None, None]:
        """
        Process streaming audio and yield results as they become available.
        
        Args:
            audio_stream: A stream of audio data
            
        Yields:
            STTResult objects as transcription progresses
        """
        pass
```

```python
@dataclass
class STTConfig:
    model_size: str = "base"  # tiny, base, small, medium
    language: Optional[str] = None  # Language code or None for auto-detect
    use_gpu: bool = True
    beam_size: int = 5
    word_timestamps: bool = False
    
@dataclass
class STTResult:
    transcript: str
    confidence: float
    language: str
    start_time: float
    end_time: float
    word_timestamps: Optional[List[Tuple[str, float, float]]] = None
```

### Inputs
| Input | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Audio Data | numpy.ndarray | Raw audio data as a numpy array |
| Sample Rate | int | The sample rate of the audio data |
| Configuration | STTConfig | Configuration for the STT processing |

### Outputs
| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Transcript | STTResult | Transcription result with text, confidence, and metadata |

### State Management
| State Field | Type | Read/Write | Description |
|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| transcripts | List[STTResult] | Read/Write | History of transcriptions for the current session |
| audio_context | Dict | Read/Write | Audio context information for continuous processing |

### Algorithm / Processing Steps
1. Initialize the Whisper model with the configured model size and parameters
2. Set up hardware acceleration (CUDA/MPS) if available and enabled
3. For streaming mode:
   a. Implement a buffer system to collect audio segments
   b. Process each segment once it reaches a threshold length
   c. Implement overlap between segments to handle word boundaries
4. For batch mode:
   a. Process the entire audio segment at once
5. Post-process the results:
   a. Apply any text normalization or filtering
   b. Calculate confidence scores
   c. Generate timestamps if requested
6. Return results in the specified format
7. Update state with new transcription

### Error Handling
1. Audio format errors: Log error and return empty result with error flag
2. Model loading failures: Attempt to fallback to smaller model, log error if all fail
3. Insufficient audio data: Return empty result with appropriate status code
4. Hardware acceleration failures: Fallback to CPU processing with warning log

### Performance Considerations
1. Target latency: <1.5s for 5-second audio segment on target hardware
2. Memory usage: <1GB for base model, <2GB for medium model
3. Use smaller models in memory-constrained environments
4. Implement caching for repeated phrases
5. Consider quantizing models for faster inference if accuracy remains acceptable

## Validation Criteria
1. The component correctly transcribes audio with >90% word accuracy on standard test sets
2. Processing latency meets target (<1.5s for 5-second segments on reference hardware)
3. All interfaces are implemented according to specification
4. The component handles errors gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
5. Memory usage stays within specified limits
6. Integration tests with audio capture and dual-track processing pass

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
1. Test initialization with different configurations
2. Test processing of pre-recorded audio samples with known transcriptions
3. Test streaming interface with simulated audio streams
4. Test error handling with malformed inputs
5. Test language detection accuracy

### Integration Tests
1. Test end-to-end pipeline from audio capture to transcription
2. Test integration with dual-track processing
3. Test state management integration
4. Test configuration changes at runtime

### Performance Tests
1. Measure processing latency across different model sizes and audio lengths
2. Measure memory usage during continuous operation
3. Stress test with continuous transcription for extended periods
4. Measure accuracy vs. performance tradeoffs for different configurations
