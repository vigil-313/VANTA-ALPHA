# Example Dual-Track Processing Task - Processing Router Implementation

## Task Identification
- **Task ID**: TSK-V0-010
- **Component**: Dual-Track Processing
- **Phase**: Foundation
- **Priority**: High
- **Related Concepts**: [CON-HVA-001, CON-HVA-009, CON-HVA-010, CON-HVA-011, CON-HVA-012]

## Task Description
Implement the Processing Router component for the Dual-Track Processing system that intelligently routes conversations between the local model and API model based on content complexity, conversation context, and system state.

### Objective
Create an efficient routing mechanism that optimizes for response quality, latency, and resource usage by directing conversation to the appropriate processing track.

### Success Criteria
The system can accurately determine which processing track (local or API) is most appropriate for a given input, with routing decisions completing in <50ms and improving overall response quality compared to single-track approaches.

## Implementation Context
The Processing Router is a critical component in the Dual-Track Processing architecture, responsible for deciding whether each user input should be handled by the fast local model or the more powerful but higher-latency API model. This decision must balance multiple factors including query complexity, conversation context, available resources, and urgency of response.

### Task Dependencies
- **TSK-V0-008**: Implement local model integration
- **TSK-V0-009**: Implement API model integration

### Architectural Context
The Processing Router sits at the heart of the Dual-Track Processing system, receiving input from the Voice Pipeline and determining whether to route to the Local Model Component or the API Model Component. It must integrate with the LangGraph state management system to maintain conversation context and make informed routing decisions.

### Technical Requirements
1. Implement content complexity analysis to determine appropriate processing track
2. Support configurable routing policies based on system state and user preferences
3. Implement fallback mechanisms when primary track is unavailable or overloaded
4. Provide routing confidence scores and explanations for routing decisions
5. Optimize for minimizing overall response latency while maximizing response quality
6. Support dynamic adjustment of routing thresholds based on feedback

## Implementation Details

### Interfaces
```python
class ProcessingRouter:
    def __init__(self, config: RouterConfig):
        """Initialize the Processing Router with configuration."""
        pass
        
    def determine_route(self, 
                        input_text: str, 
                        conversation_state: ConversationState) -> RouteDecision:
        """
        Determine which processing track to use for the given input.
        
        Args:
            input_text: The user input text to route
            conversation_state: The current conversation state
            
        Returns:
            RouteDecision containing the selected route and metadata
        """
        pass
        
    def update_policy(self, policy_update: PolicyUpdate) -> None:
        """
        Update the routing policy based on feedback or system state.
        
        Args:
            policy_update: The policy update to apply
        """
        pass
```

```python
@dataclass
class RouterConfig:
    complexity_threshold: float = 0.65  # Threshold for routing to API model
    max_local_tokens: int = 100  # Maximum input tokens for local model
    use_conversation_context: bool = True  # Consider conversation context in routing
    enable_dynamic_adjustment: bool = True  # Enable dynamic threshold adjustment
    
@dataclass
class RouteDecision:
    route: Literal["local", "api"]
    confidence: float
    reason: str
    estimated_latency: float
    fallback_route: Optional[Literal["local", "api"]] = None
```

### Inputs
| Input | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Input Text | str | The user input text to route |
| Conversation State | ConversationState | Current conversation context and state |
| System State | SystemState | Current system resource state and availability |

### Outputs
| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Route Decision | RouteDecision | Decision about which track to use with metadata |

### State Management
| State Field | Type | Read/Write | Description |
|-------------|------|------------|-------------|
| routing_history | List[RouteDecision] | Read/Write | History of routing decisions |
| policy_adjustments | Dict | Read/Write | Dynamic policy adjustments based on feedback |

### Algorithm / Processing Steps
1. Analyze input complexity:
   a. Calculate input length and linguistic complexity metrics
   b. Identify presence of specialized knowledge requirements
   c. Detect computational requirements (math, logic, etc.)
2. Consider conversation context:
   a. Analyze conversation flow and continuity
   b. Check if following up on a previous API response
   c. Consider conversation depth and complexity
3. Evaluate system state:
   a. Check resource availability for each track
   b. Consider current load and queue depths
   c. Estimate response latency for each track
4. Apply routing policy:
   a. Compare complexity metrics against thresholds
   b. Apply policy rules and weights
   c. Determine primary and fallback routes
5. Record decision and reasoning
6. Return routing decision with metadata

### Error Handling
1. Input analysis failure: Fallback to length-based routing, log warning
2. State access errors: Use default routing policy, log error
3. Policy configuration errors: Use safe default values, log error
4. Both tracks unavailable: Queue for processing when available, return appropriate status

### Performance Considerations
1. Routing decision latency: <50ms per decision
2. Memory footprint: <50MB for router component
3. Implement caching for similar inputs to avoid recomputation
4. Use efficient text analysis algorithms optimized for short text
5. Consider batching analysis operations where possible

## Validation Criteria
1. Routing decisions complete within 50ms (95th percentile)
2. Overall response quality improves compared to single-track approaches
3. System correctly identifies complex queries requiring API model
4. System correctly identifies simple queries that can be handled by local model
5. Fallback mechanisms activate appropriately when primary track is unavailable
6. Dynamic policy adjustments improve routing accuracy over time

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
1. Test routing decisions with various input complexities
2. Test consideration of conversation context in decisions
3. Test policy adjustment mechanisms
4. Test error handling with various failure scenarios
5. Test performance under load

### Integration Tests
1. Test integration with local and API model components
2. Test end-to-end flow from input to routing to processing
3. Test state management integration
4. Test handling of system state changes

### Performance Tests
1. Measure routing decision latency under various conditions
2. Measure overall response latency improvement from intelligent routing
3. Measure resource utilization efficiency
4. Benchmark routing accuracy against human-judged complexity
