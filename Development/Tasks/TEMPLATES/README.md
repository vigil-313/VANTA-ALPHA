# VISTA Implementation Task Templates

## Overview

This directory contains templates and examples for VISTA-compliant implementation tasks. These templates are designed to provide clear guidance for implementing components of the VANTA system, ensuring consistency and completeness across the implementation process.

## Template Structure

The base template structure is defined in `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` and includes the following sections:

### Task Identification
Basic metadata about the task, including:
- **Task ID**: Unique identifier in the format TSK-V0-XXX
- **Component**: Which system component this task applies to
- **Phase**: Which implementation phase this task belongs to
- **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low
- **Related Concepts**: References to relevant concepts in the Knowledge Graph

### Task Description
A clear description of what the task entails, including:
- **Objective**: A concise statement of the task's primary goal
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable criteria for task completion

### Implementation Context
How the task fits into the larger system, including:
- **Task Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first
- **Architectural Context**: How this task relates to the system architecture
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific requirements for the implementation

### Implementation Details
Detailed information for implementers, including:
- **Interfaces**: Code interfaces that must be implemented
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Detailed specification of inputs and outputs
- **State Management**: How the component interacts with system state
- **Algorithm/Processing Steps**: Step-by-step implementation guidance
- **Error Handling**: How to handle potential errors
- **Performance Considerations**: Performance requirements and optimizations

### Validation Criteria
Specific criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete.

### Testing Approach
How the implementation should be tested, including unit, integration, and performance tests.

### Effort Estimation
Estimates of the effort required to complete the task.

### Code References
References to existing code or documentation that provides context.

### Additional Resources
Links to helpful resources for implementation.

### Implementation Notes
Section to be filled in during or after implementation with important details and decisions.

### Implementation Completion
Metadata about the completed implementation.

## Example Tasks

This directory includes example task templates for different components:

1. **EXAMPLE_VOICE_PIPELINE_TASK.md**: Example task for implementing the Speech-to-Text component of the Voice Pipeline
2. **EXAMPLE_DUAL_TRACK_TASK.md**: Example task for implementing the Processing Router component of the Dual-Track Processing system

These examples demonstrate how to use the template for different types of tasks and components.

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Tasks

1. Copy the `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` file
2. Rename it according to the component and task (e.g., `VOICE_PIPELINE_STT_TASK.md`)
3. Fill in all required sections with detailed information
4. Add the task to the implementation plan and update dependencies as needed

### Task Naming Convention

Task files should follow the naming convention:
`<COMPONENT>_<FEATURE>_TASK.md`

For example:
- `VOICE_PIPELINE_STT_TASK.md`
- `MEMORY_ENGINE_VECTORDB_TASK.md`
- `DUAL_TRACK_ROUTER_TASK.md`

### Task ID Assignment

Task IDs should be assigned sequentially within each component area:
- Voice Pipeline: TSK-V0-001 to TSK-V0-099
- Memory Engine: TSK-V0-100 to TSK-V0-199
- Dual-Track Processing: TSK-V0-200 to TSK-V0-299
- Integration: TSK-V0-300 to TSK-V0-399
- Core Architecture: TSK-V0-400 to TSK-V0-499
- Testing: TSK-V0-500 to TSK-V0-599

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable guidance for implementation
2. **Be Complete**: Fill in all relevant sections of the template
3. **Reference Knowledge Graph**: Link to relevant concepts in the knowledge graph
4. **Include Code Examples**: Provide interface definitions and example code where helpful
5. **Define Clear Success Criteria**: Make validation criteria specific and measurable
6. **Consider Dependencies**: Clearly identify dependencies on other tasks
7. **Update Implementation Notes**: Document important decisions and learnings during implementation
