# VANTA Test Framework

This document describes the comprehensive testing framework implemented for the VANTA system.

## Overview

The VANTA Test Framework provides a structured approach to testing all components of the system, from individual units to integrated flows and performance characteristics. The framework is designed to facilitate test-driven development and ensure continuous validation of the system's functionality, reliability, and performance.

## Framework Components

```

### Key Components

1. **Test Configuration**: Configured in `pytest.ini` with appropriate settings for test discovery, markers, and logging.

2. **Fixtures**: Reusable test components in `fixtures/fixtures.py` for common test setups.

3. **Mock Objects**: Simulation objects in `mocks/` for testing components in isolation:
   - `MockAudioCapture`: Simulates audio capture devices
   - `MockTTS`: Simulates text-to-speech systems
   - `MockLLM`: Simulates language models
   - `MockStreamingLLM`: Simulates streaming language models

4. **Testing Utilities**:
   - `test_utils.py`: General utilities for testing
   - `audio_test_utils.py`: Audio-specific testing utilities
   - `model_utils.py`: Model testing utilities
   - `performance_utils.py`: Performance testing utilities
   - `langgraph_test_utils.py`: LangGraph testing utilities

5. **Example Tests**: Implemented for each test type to demonstrate testing patterns.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on validating individual components in isolation. These tests:
- Target small, focused pieces of functionality
- Use mock objects to replace dependencies
- Are fast and reliable
- Provide high coverage of code paths

Example: Testing an audio processing function with mock input data.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly. These tests:
- Test the interaction between components
- Validate workflows across component boundaries
- Ensure proper communication between parts of the system

Example: Testing a voice pipeline that captures audio, processes it, and synthesizes a response.

### Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate the system's efficiency and resource usage. These tests:
- Measure execution time and latency
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Set benchmarks for acceptable performance
- Verify performance on target hardware profiles

Example: Testing response time of a dual-track processing flow.

## Testing Utilities

### Audio Testing

The framework includes specialized utilities for audio testing:
- Generation of test audio signals
- Audio feature extraction
- Speech segment detection
- Audio similarity comparison

### Model Testing

Utilities for testing with machine learning models:
- Registry access for test models
- Smallest model selection
- Model availability verification

### Performance Testing

Performance testing utilities include:
- Execution time measurement
- Memory usage tracking
- Benchmarking with statistical analysis

### LangGraph Testing

Utilities for testing LangGraph components:
- Mock node creation
- Mock graph creation
- Graph flow verification

## Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Run tests with a specific marker
pytest -m "unit and not slow"

# Run with code coverage
pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=html
```

### Test Markers

Custom markers are defined to categorize tests:
- `unit`: Unit tests
- `integration`: Integration tests
- `performance`: Performance tests
- `slow`: Tests that take a long time to run
- `audio`: Tests that require audio capability
- `model`: Tests that require ML models

## Test Writing Guidelines

### Structure

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:
1. **Arrange**: Set up the test conditions
2. **Act**: Execute the code being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `test_*.py`
- Test classes: `Test*`
- Test functions: `test_*`

### Documentation

Each test should include:
- A clear docstring explaining what is being tested
- Comments for complex test logic
- VISTA compliant documentation references

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Small, Focused Tests**: Each test should verify one aspect of behavior
3. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks for external systems and slow operations
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and boundary cases
5. **Readable Tests**: Tests should be clear and serve as documentation
6. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage, especially in critical components
7. **Performance Baselines**: Establish clear performance criteria for tests

## Integration with CI/CD

The test framework is designed to integrate with CI/CD pipelines:
- GitHub Actions configuration provided
- Code coverage reporting
- Test execution as part of pull request validation

## Conclusion

The VANTA Test Framework provides a comprehensive solution for testing all aspects of the system. By following the guidelines and using the provided utilities, developers can ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of VANTA components.
