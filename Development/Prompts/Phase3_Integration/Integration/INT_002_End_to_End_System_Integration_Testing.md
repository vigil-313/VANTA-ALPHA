## Objective
Implement comprehensive end-to-end system integration testing that validates the complete VANTA system workflow including voice processing, memory-enhanced dual-track processing, LangGraph orchestration, and optimization capabilities to ensure all components work together seamlessly in real-world scenarios.

## Context
Building on the completed memory system integration (TASK-INT-003) and the full dual-track optimization infrastructure (TASK-DP-003), we now need comprehensive end-to-end testing to validate the complete VANTA system. This includes testing the complex interactions between voice processing, memory system, dual-track processing with optimization, LangGraph workflow orchestration, and all error recovery mechanisms.

The testing framework must validate that:
- Voice input is properly processed through the complete pipeline
- Memory context is correctly retrieved and used in processing
- Dual-track processing operates correctly with memory enhancement
- Optimization system adapts based on real-time performance data
- LangGraph workflow orchestrates all components seamlessly
- Error recovery maintains conversation continuity
- Performance monitoring provides accurate system insights
- Cross-session persistence maintains state correctly
