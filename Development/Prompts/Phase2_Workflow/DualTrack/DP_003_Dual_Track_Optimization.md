## Implementation Guidance

### Optimization System Architecture

The optimization system should be structured with three main components:

1. **MetricsCollector**: Collects and analyzes performance data
   ```python
   class MetricsCollector:
       def __init__(self, config: OptimizationConfig):
           self.metrics = deque(maxlen=config.metrics_window_size)
           self.metrics_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: deque(maxlen=config.metrics_window_size))
       
       def record_metric(self, metric: PerformanceMetrics) -> None:
           # Thread-safe metric recording
           pass
       
       def get_metrics_summary(self, path: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
           # Statistical analysis of collected metrics
           pass
   ```

2. **ResourceMonitor**: Tracks system resource usage
   ```python
   class ResourceMonitor:
       def __init__(self, config: OptimizationConfig):
           self.current_usage = {}
           self._monitoring = False
       
       def start_monitoring(self) -> None:
           # Start background resource monitoring thread
           pass
       
       def check_constraints(self, constraints: ResourceConstraints) -> Dict[str, bool]:
           # Check for resource constraint violations
           pass
   ```

3. **AdaptiveOptimizer**: Implements intelligent adaptation
   ```python
   class AdaptiveOptimizer:
       def __init__(self, config: OptimizationConfig, metrics_collector: MetricsCollector, resource_monitor: ResourceMonitor):
           self.routing_preferences = {
               "local_bias": 0.5,
               "parallel_threshold": 0.7,
               "timeout_multiplier": 1.0,
               "quality_threshold": 0.8
           }
       
       def adapt_strategy(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
           # Analyze metrics and adapt optimization strategy
           pass
   ```

### Integration with Existing Components

The optimization system should integrate seamlessly with existing dual-track components:

```python
# In ProcessingRouter
def determine_path(self, query: str, context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> RoutingDecision:
    # Get optimization recommendations
    if self.optimizer:
        recommendations = self.optimizer.get_optimization_recommendations(query, context)
        # Apply recommendations to routing decision
    
    # Existing routing logic with optimization enhancements
    pass

# In DualTrackGraphNodes
def router_node(state: VANTAState) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    request_id = state.get("request_id", str(uuid.uuid4()))
    
    # Record request start for optimization tracking
    if optimizer:
        optimizer.record_request_start(request_id, query, context)
    
    # Existing routing logic
    pass
```

### Configuration Structure

```python
@dataclass
class OptimizationConfig:
    # Strategy selection
    strategy: OptimizationStrategy = OptimizationStrategy.ADAPTIVE
    
    # Resource constraints
    constraints: ResourceConstraints = field(default_factory=ResourceConstraints)
    
    # Monitoring configuration
    metrics_window_size: int = 100
    adaptation_interval_seconds: float = 30.0
    monitor_interval_seconds: float = 1.0
    
    # Feature toggles
    enable_caching: bool = True
    enable_preemption: bool = True
    enable_resource_monitoring: bool = True
    
    # Cache configuration
    cache_ttl_seconds: float = 300.0
```

### Metrics and Monitoring

The system should track comprehensive metrics:

```python
# Performance metrics tracked per request
- latency_ms: End-to-end request processing time
- tokens_processed: Number of tokens in request and response
- memory_usage_mb: Peak memory usage during processing
- cpu_usage_percent: Average CPU usage during processing
- gpu_usage_percent: GPU utilization if available
- cost_estimate: Estimated cost for API requests
- quality_score: Response quality assessment
- success: Whether the request completed successfully
- error_type: Type of error if request failed

# System-wide metrics calculated
- success_rate: Percentage of successful requests
- avg_latency_ms: Average latency across all requests
- p95_latency_ms: 95th percentile latency
- total_cost: Total estimated costs
- resource_utilization: Current system resource usage
- constraint_violations: Active resource constraint violations
```

### Adaptive Strategy Implementation

The adaptive optimizer should implement multiple optimization strategies:

```python
# Strategy implementations
def _adapt_for_latency_focus(self, metrics):
    # Optimize for minimal latency
    if api_faster_than_local:
        increase_api_preference()
    else:
        increase_local_preference()

def _adapt_for_resource_efficiency(self, metrics):
    # Optimize for resource conservation
    if resource_constraints_violated:
        reduce_parallel_processing()
        prefer_lighter_models()

def _adapt_for_quality_focus(self, metrics):
    # Optimize for response quality
    if quality_scores_low:
        prefer_higher_quality_models()
        increase_timeouts_for_better_results()

def _adapt_for_cost_optimization(self, metrics):
    # Optimize for cost efficiency
    if costs_too_high:
        prefer_local_models()
        reduce_api_usage()
```

### Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation

Implement comprehensive error handling:

```python
# Error handling patterns
try:
    # Optimization operation
    pass
except OptimizationError as e:
    # Log error and continue with fallback behavior
    logger.warning(f"Optimization error: {e}, using fallback")
    return fallback_recommendations()
except Exception as e:
    # Unexpected error - disable optimization temporarily
    logger.error(f"Unexpected optimization error: {e}")
    self.disable_temporarily()
    return default_recommendations()
```

### Documentation Guidelines

Each optimization component should include:
- Clear purpose and responsibility documentation
- Configuration options and their effects
- Integration points with other system components
- Performance characteristics and overhead
- Error conditions and recovery mechanisms
- Example usage patterns and best practices

The optimization system should be well-documented to enable easy configuration and troubleshooting in different deployment scenarios.
