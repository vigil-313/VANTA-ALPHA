# Test Specifications

## Purpose
This directory contains test specifications and plans that define testing requirements separate from implementation. These files describe what should be tested, acceptance criteria, and test strategies without implementation details.

## File Organization
- UNIT_TESTS.md - Specifications for unit tests
- INTEGRATION_TESTS.md - Specifications for API integration tests
- SECURITY_TESTS.md - Security testing requirements
- PERFORMANCE_TESTS.md - Performance benchmarks and testing plans

## Content Guidelines
Each test specification should include:
- Test scope and objectives
- Test cases with input and expected output
- Edge cases to be covered
- Performance requirements (if applicable)
- References to technical requirements being verified

## Relationship with Implementation
The test specifications in this directory define requirements, while the actual test code resides in:
```
/Development/Implementation/{project}/tests/
```

Test implementations should reference these specifications to ensure full coverage of requirements.

## Example Structure
```
# Unit Tests: User Model

## Test Cases
1. User Creation
   - Input: Valid user data
   - Expected: User successfully created in database
   - Validation: Check database contains user with matching fields

2. Password Hashing
   - Input: User with password "test123"
   - Expected: Password stored as hash, not plaintext
   - Validation: Compare stored value against bcrypt.compare()
```
