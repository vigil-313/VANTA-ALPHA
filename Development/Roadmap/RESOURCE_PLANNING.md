### Cost Management Strategies

1. **Local-First Processing**: Prioritize local computation for privacy-sensitive operations
2. **Caching**: Implement aggressive caching for API responses
3. **Batch Processing**: Consolidate API requests when possible
4. **Model Compression**: Use quantized models to reduce computational requirements
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic features, add resource-intensive ones later
