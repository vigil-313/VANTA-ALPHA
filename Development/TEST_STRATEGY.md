# Test Strategy

## Document ID
[DOC-DEV-TEST-1]

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the VANTA system, describing the approach, categories, automation, and validation criteria for ensuring system quality and reliability.

## Testing Approach

The VANTA testing approach is structured around the following principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before or alongside feature implementation
2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Multiple test types ensure thorough validation
3. **Automation First**: Automated testing is prioritized for reliability and repeatability
4. **Environment Consistency**: Tests run in containerized environments for consistency
5. **Continuous Validation**: Tests run automatically during development and integration

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Target individual components in isolation
- Use mock objects to replace dependencies
- Each test focuses on a single unit of functionality
- Located in `tests/unit/` directory
- Use pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.unit`

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between multiple components
- Validate workflows across component boundaries
- May use limited external dependencies
- Located in `tests/integration/` directory
- Use pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.integration`

### Performance Tests
- Measure execution time and latency
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Set benchmarks for acceptable performance
- Located in `tests/performance/` directory
- Use pytest markers: `@pytest.mark.performance`

### Additional Test Categories
- **Audio Tests**: Tests that require audio processing capabilities
- **Model Tests**: Tests that require machine learning models
- **Slow Tests**: Long-running tests that may be skipped during quick validation

## Test Automation

### Framework
- Built on pytest with custom extensions
- Custom fixtures for common test setups
- Test utilities for specific component types
- Performance benchmarking tools

### Test Execution
- Run locally during development
- Run in CI/CD pipelines for pull requests
- Scheduled runs for performance tests
- Optional selective test execution by category

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Code coverage reporting
- Test failure notifications
- Integration with pull request validation

## Test Resources

### Mock Objects
- MockAudioCapture: For audio input testing
- MockTTS: For text-to-speech testing
- MockLLM: For language model testing
- MockStreamingLLM: For streaming language model testing

### Test Utilities
- Audio test utilities: For audio processing validation
- Model test utilities: For ML model validation
- Performance utilities: For benchmarking and profiling
- LangGraph test utilities: For workflow validation

## Validation Criteria

### Component Validation
Each component must meet these criteria:
- Unit tests cover all public methods
- Integration tests validate component interactions
- Performance tests ensure acceptable speed and resource usage
- All tests pass consistently across environments

### System Validation
The overall system must meet these criteria:
- End-to-end test scenarios pass successfully
- System performs within latency targets
- Resource usage remains within hardware constraints
- Recovery from error conditions works as expected

### Model Testing Criteria
AI models must meet these criteria:
- Models load correctly with proper initialization
- Model outputs match expected format and quality
- Inference performance meets latency requirements
- Model fallbacks function properly when primary models fail

### Voice Pipeline Criteria
Voice components must meet these criteria:
- Audio capture processes correct sample rates and formats
- Speech recognition meets accuracy thresholds
- Text-to-speech output quality matches requirements
- End-to-end latency meets conversational requirements

## Implementation
The test framework has been implemented in:
- `/Development/Implementation/tests/` directory
- Test documentation available in `/Development/Implementation/tests/README.md`
- Additional framework documentation in `/Development/Implementation/TEST_FRAMEWORK.md`

## Next Steps
- Validate test framework in Docker environment
- Create CI/CD pipeline integration
- Develop additional component-specific tests
- Implement comprehensive model validation
